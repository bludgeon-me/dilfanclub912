        <p>The domain for this site expires at the end of this month and as much as I wish it could be here forever that never seems to be the case
        </p>
        <p>I'm pretty sure you don't check this and haven't since our break up, but in the case that you do I want you to know that you still run through my mind daily, and you'll eternally have someone thinking of you and wishing the best for you. As painful as it is that I won't be able to see you become the amazing woman I know you can be and always have been. The way I treated you will always be my biggest regret in this life, I'm deeply sorry for how rotten I allowed our relationship to become after promising myself that I wouldn't just be another man that hurts you and ends up feeling like a waste of time. I hope that the fond memories can still bring you a smile if ever necessary.</p>
